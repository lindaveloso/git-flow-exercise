# Instructions

In a large bowl, lined with a brining or roasting bag, combine buttermilk, garlic, onion slices, 1/2 cup hot sauce and salt (if using).
Add chicken and tie the bag close so that the chicken is completely submerged in the brine.
Refrigerate for up to 3 hours.
Pour off the brine and shake off excess brine from chicken. (You can rinse if desired. I didn't)
Combine the seasoning blend.
Taste the seasoning blend to make sure it is salty and spicy enough for your taste. Adjust the seasoning if needed.(It should taste bold)
Place chicken on a baking tray and sprinkle on up to half of the seasoning mixture generously over the chicken on both sides. Set aside.
Mix the rest of the spices into the flour. DO THIS GENTLY. IF THAT SPICY FLOUR "SMOKE" GETS IN YOUR NOSTRILS IT WILL BURN. TRUST ME. Taste the flour and make sure it tastes seasoned Add in more seasoning to your liking. Flour SHOULD taste seasoned. (I usually add in more salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne)
Place the flour mixture into a large paper bag.
Add chicken to the bag.
Close the bag tightly and shake to coat the chicken.
Remove the coated chicken from bag and shake off the excess flour. Set aside.
In a large dish, combine eggs, water, hot sauce and garlic powder.
Dip each piece of coated chicken into the egg mixture and shake off the excess egg mixture. (Use one had to place the chicken in the mixture and the other hand to pull it out to minimize clumping)
Place chicken back into paper bag and shake to coat one last time.
Remove chicken from bag and place on a plate. It's time to fry!
Add oil to deep skillet and heat until a test piece of flour fries gently. (about 350 degrees. See Note)
Add chicken to skillet and cook until golden. (Oil should completely cover chicken. Fry dark meats together and white meats together. Do not overcrowd the pan.)
When done, place chicken on a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Sprinkle with cajun seasoning as soon as the chicken come out of the oil, if desired.
Serve hot and add hot sauce!
